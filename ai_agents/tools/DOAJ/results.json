        "abstract": "\nSelection of important features is very vital in machine learning tasks involving high-dimensional dataset with large features. It helps in reducing the dimensionality of a dataset and improving model performance. Most of the feature selection techniques have restriction in the kind of dataset to be used. This study proposed a feature selection technique that is based on statistical lift measure to select important features from a dataset. The proposed technique is a generic approach that can be used in any binary classification dataset. The technique successfully determined the most important feature subset and outperformed the existing techniques. The proposed technique was tested on lungs cancer dataset and happiness classification dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed technique in selecting important features subset was evaluated and compared with other existing techniques, namely Chi-Square, Pearson Correlation and Information Gain. Both the proposed and the existing techniques were evaluated on five machine learning models using four standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The experimental results of the proposed technique on lung cancer dataset shows that logistic regression, decision tree, adaboost, gradient boost and random forest produced a predictive accuracy of 0.919%, 0.935%, 0.919%, 0.935% and 0.935% respectively, and that of happiness classification dataset produced a predictive accuracy of 0.758%, 0.689%, 0.724%, 0.655% and 0.689% on random forest, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, gradient boost and cat boost respectively, which outperformed the existing techniques.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract Minimal change disease (MCD) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome. Due to its rapid progression, early detection is essential; however, definitive diagnosis requires invasive kidney biopsy. This study aims to develop non-invasive predictive models for diagnosing MCD by machine learning. We retrospectively collected data on demographic characteristics, blood tests, and urine tests from patients with nephrotic syndrome who underwent kidney biopsy. We applied four machine learning algorithms—TabPFN, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network—and logistic regression. We compared their performance using stratified 5-repeated 5-fold cross-validation for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Variable importance was evaluated using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. A total of 248 patients were included, with 82 cases (33%) were diagnosed with MCD. TabPFN demonstrated the best performance with an AUROC of 0.915 (95% CI 0.896–0.932) and an AUPRC of 0.840 (95% CI 0.807–0.872). The SHAP methods identified C3, total cholesterol, and urine red blood cells as key predictors for TabPFN, consistent with previous reports. Machine learning models could be valuable non-invasive diagnostic tools for MCD.",

        "abstract": "Solving the challenge of occupancy prediction is crucial in order to design efficient and sustainable office spaces and automate lighting, heating, and air circulation in these facilities. In office spaces where large areas need to be observed, multiple sensors must be used for full coverage. In these cases, it is normally important to keep the costs low, but also to make sure that the privacy of the people who use such environments are preserved. Low-cost and low-resolution heat (thermal) sensors can be very useful to build solutions that address these concerns. However, they are extremely sensitive to noise artifacts which might be caused by heat prints of the people who left the space or by other objects, which are either using electricity or exposed to sunlight. There are some earlier solutions for occupancy prediction that employ low-resolution heat sensors; however, they have not addressed nor compensated for such heat artifacts. Therefore, in this paper, we presented a low-cost and low-energy consuming smart space implementation to predict the number of people in the environment based on whether their activity is static or dynamic in time. We used a low-resolution <inline-formula><math display=\"inline\"><semantics><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></semantics></math></inline-formula> and non-intrusive heat sensor to collect data from an actual meeting room. We proposed two novel workflows to predict the occupancy; one that is based on computer vision and one based on machine learning. Besides comparing the advantages and disadvantages of these different workflows, we used several state-of-the-art explainability methods in order to provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm parameters and how the image properties influence the resulting performance. Furthermore, we analyzed noise resources that affect the heat sensor data. The experiments show that the feature classification based method gives high accuracy when the data are clean from noise artifacts. However, when there are noise artifacts, the computer vision based method can compensate for those artifacts providing robust results. Because the computer vision based method requires an empty room recording, the feature classification based method should be chosen either when there is no expectancy of seeing noise artifacts in the data or when there is no empty recording available. We hope that our analysis brings light into understanding how to handle very low-resolution heat images in these environments. The presented workflows could be used in various domains and applications other than smart offices, where occupancy prediction is essential, e.g., for elderly care.",

However, it is still confronted with the challenge of word ambiguities that force NMT to choose among several translation candidates that represent different senses of an input word. This research presents a case study using Korean word sense disambiguation (WSD) to improve NMT performance. First, we constructed a Korean lexical semantic network (LSN) as a large-scale lexical semantic knowledge base. Then, based on the Korean LSN, we built a Korean WSD preprocessor that can annotate the correct sense of Korean words in the training corpus. Finally, we conducted a series of translation experiments using Korean-English, Korean-French, Korean-Spanish, and Korean-Japanese language pairs. The experimental results show that our Korean WSD system can significantly improve the translation quality of NMT in terms of the BLEU, TER, and DLRATIO metrics. On average, it improved the precision by 2.94 BLEU points and improved translation error prevention by 4.04 TER points and 4.51 DLRATIO points for all the language pairs.",

Automated speech analysis shows promise in detecting symptom severity in depressed patients. This project aimed to identify discriminating speech features between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HCs) by examining associations with symptom severity measures. Methods Forty-four MDD patients from the Psychiatry Department, University Hospital Aachen, Germany and fifty-two HCs were recruited. Participants described positive and negative life events, which were recorded for analysis. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression gauged depression severity. Transcribed audio recordings underwent feature extraction, including acoustics, speech rate, and content. Machine learning models including speech features and neuropsychological assessments, were used to differentiate between the MDD patients and HCs. Results Acoustic variables such as pitch and loudness differed significantly between the MDD patients and HCs (effect sizes 𝜼2 between 0.183 and 0.3, p < 0.001). Furthermore, variables pertaining to temporality, lexical richness, and speech sentiment displayed moderate to high effect sizes (𝜼2 between 0.062 and 0.143, p < 0.02). A support vector machine (SVM) model based on 10 acoustic features showed a high performance (AUC = 0.93) in differentiating between HCs and patients with MDD, comparable to an SVM based on the BDI-II (AUC = 0.99, p = 0.01). Conclusions This study identified robust speech features associated with MDD. A machine learning model based on speech features yielded similar results to an established pen-and-paper depression assessment. In the future, these findings may shape voice-based biomarkers, enhancing clinical diagnosis and MDD monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The existing static voltage stability margin evaluation methods cannot meet the actual demand of current power grid well in terms of calculation speed and accuracy. Thus, this paper proposes a static voltage stability margin prediction method based on a graph attention network (GAT) and a long short‐term memory network (LSTM) to predict the static voltage stability margin of a power system accurately, fast, and effectively, considering new energy uncertainty. First, an innovative machine learning framework named the GAT‐LSTM is designed to extract highly representative power grid operation features considering the spatial‐temporal correlation of the power grid operation. Then, a static voltage stability margin prediction method based on the GAT‐LSTM is developed. Particularly, considering the influence of new energy power uncertainty, two loss functions of certainty and uncertainty are used in the proposed method to predict the voltage stability margin and voltage fluctuation range. Finally, the IEEE39‐bus power system and a practical power system are employed to verify the proposed method. The results show that the computational speed of the proposed method is greatly improved compared to the traditional methods not based on machine learning; the computation results are more accurate and reliable than the existing machine learning methods. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method has higher scalability and applicability.",

        "abstract": "As the popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) and smart grids continues to rise, so does the demand for batteries. Within the landscape of battery-powered energy storage systems, the battery management system (BMS) is crucial. It provides key functions such as battery state estimation (including state of charge, state of health, battery safety, and thermal management) as well as cell balancing. Its primary role is to ensure safe battery operation. However, due to the limited memory and computational capacity of onboard chips, achieving this goal is challenging, as both theory and practical evidence suggest. Given the immense amount of battery data produced over its operational life, the scientific community is increasingly turning to cloud computing for data storage and analysis. This cloud-based digital solution presents a more flexible and efficient alternative to traditional methods that often require significant hardware investments. The integration of machine learning is becoming an essential tool for extracting patterns and insights from vast amounts of observational data. As a result, the future points towards the development of a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced BMS. This will notably improve the predictive and modeling capacity for long-range connections across various timescales, by combining the strength of physical process models with the versatility of machine learning techniques.",

        "abstract": "Agriculture is a vital component of Egypt's economy; therefore, using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in agricultural planning in Egypt has significant benefits regarding water management, site appropriateness assessment, flood risk mitigation, and infrastructure construction. It is also essential for planners to make more informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and support sustainable farming practices. This research paper investigates the accuracy of obtaining DEM data from four free global models (STRM30, ALOS30, COP30, and TanDEM-X90). The global DEM data has been compared to an actual GNSS-RTK DEM data surveyed onsite for two agricultural block areas in Aswan, the southern Government of Egypt. The two blocks are a part of a national project. For Block I and II, the RMSE of the Model STRM30 was 2.92 m and 3.59 m, respectively, indicating a poorer solution. Regarding accuracy, the ALOS30 model ranks third, reporting an RMSE of 2.58 m for block II and 3.30 m for block I. COP30 has an RMSE value of 1.06 m for blocks I and II and.91 m overall. TanDEM-X90 is the most accurate model in this investigation; block I provided an RMSE of 0.90 m with an SD of 0.58 m (SD95% = 0.38 m). After removing the anomalies, the model's stated RMSE for block II was 0.34 m, with an SD value of 0.62 m and 1.03 m. According to the classification using machine learning algorithms, with an accuracy of 84.7% for block I and 85% for block II, TanDEM-X90 is the best solution.",

        "abstract": "While current research predominantly focuses on image-based colorization, the domain of video-based colorization remains relatively unexplored. Many existing video colorization techniques operate frame-by-frame, often overlooking the critical aspect of temporal coherence between successive frames. This approach can result in inconsistencies across frames, leading to undesirable effects like flickering or abrupt color transitions between frames. To address these challenges, we combine the generative capabilities of a fine-tuned latent diffusion model with an autoregressive conditioning mechanism to ensure temporal consistency in automatic speaker video colorization. We demonstrate strong improvements on established quality metrics compared to existing methods, namely, PSNR, SSIM, FID, FVD, NIQE and BRISQUE. Specifically, we achieve an 18% improvement in performance when FVD is employed as the evaluation metric. Furthermore, we performed a subjective study, where users preferred LatentColorization to the existing state-of-the-art DeOldify 80% of the time. Our dataset combines conventional datasets and videos from television/movies. A short demonstration of our results can be seen in some example videos available at <uri>https://youtu.be/vDbzsZdFuxM</uri>.",

        "abstract": "The cohesion of an object-oriented class refers to the relatedness of its methods and attributes. Constructors, destructors, and access methods are special types of methods featuring unique characteristics that can artificially affect class cohesion quantification. Methods within a class can also directly or transitively invoke each other, representing another cohesion aspect not considered by most existing cohesion measures. The impact of considering special methods (SPs) and transitive relations (TRs) in cohesion measurement on the abilities of the measures to predict inheritance reusability has yet to be investigated. In this paper, we empirically explored this effect. We applied a statistical technique to test the significance of the cohesion value changes across seven scenarios of ignoring or considering SPs and TRs. In addition, we applied a machine learning-based technique to build inheritance reusability prediction models using each of the considered measures and scenarios, evaluated the classification performance of the prediction models, and statistically compared the inheritance reusability prediction results. The results show that for most of the considered measures, the ignorance/consideration of SPs and TRs changed the cohesion values and the corresponding prediction significantly. Based on the study findings, when building inheritance reusability prediction models, software engineers are advised to 1) combine cohesion with other quality factors; 2) exclude the TRs from cohesion quantification; and 3) decide whether to consider or ignore SPs in cohesion quantification based on the selected measure(s) to be used in the prediction model, as this decision differs from one measure to another.",
